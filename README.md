# Example of Person class | TypeScript

The code is an example of using TypeScript to create a Person class that models information about an individual. Here's a breakdown of the code:



## Features

- Interface PersonData:

Defines the data structure to represent information about a person (first name, last name, age, and optionally, email).

- Class Person:

Has private fields to store information about the person (first name, last name, age, email).
The class constructor takes a PersonData object to initialize an instance of the class.
Getters and setters ensure safe access to private fields.
The displayInfo method outputs information about the person to the console.

- Usage Example:

An instance of the Person class is created with predefined data.
## Installation

To run the code:

Ensure you have TypeScript installed 
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
Save the code in a 
```.ts file```
Compile it using the 

TypeScript compiler: ```tsc filename.ts.```

Run the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js: 
```node filename.js.```
